    dispatch!(s, r)

Internal function used for dispatching requests in `SimResource` and

    request!(s, r, quantity, request)
    request!(s, q, request)

Function used to register request for resource in `SimResource`
or object from `SimQueue`.

In `SimResource` requested `quantity` must be provided and
`request` accepts only `Scheduler` argument (it must know what it wanted).
Returns tuple of:
* `true` if successfull and `false` when too many requests were made
* `ResourceRequest` object created

In `SimResource` function `request` must accept one argument `Scheduler`.
In `SimQueue` function `request` must accept two arguments `Scheduler` and object.

"""
    waive!(r, res_request)
    waive!(q, request)

Allows to remove first occurence that would be served
of `res_request` from `SimResource` or `request` from `SimQueue`.

Returns `true` on success and `false` if `res_request`
or `request` respectively was not found.
"""
function waive! end

"""
    provide!(s, r, quantity)
    provide!(s, q, object)

Allows to fill `SimResource` with `quantity` or `SimQueue` with `object`.

In `SimResource` changes the balance of `r.quantity`. Given quantity may be
any number, but the balance of `SimResource` will be changed
only in `lo`-`hi` range. Returns the actual change in `SimResource` balance.

In `SimQueue` adds `object` to `q.queue`. Returns `true` on success and
`false` if there were too many objects in queue already.
